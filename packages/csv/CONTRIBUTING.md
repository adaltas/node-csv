## How to contribute to CoffeeScript

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to have [tests](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/tree/master/test).

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/tree/master/src). If you’re writting a test and if you're just getting started with CoffeeScript, there’s a nice [style guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide).

* Documentation is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv-docs) and you are invited to submit pull request with your changes. For conveniency, you can also browse the website and click on the edit link present at the top of every pages.
