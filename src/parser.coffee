Parsing
=======

The library extend the [EventEmitter][event] and emit the following events:

*   *row*   
  Emitted by the parser on each line with the line content as an array of fields.
*   *end*   
  Emitted when no more data will be parsed.
*   *error*   
  Emitted when an error occured.

  `write(chars)`
  --------------

  Parse a string which may hold multiple lines.
  Private state object is enriched on each character until 
  transform is called on a new line.
