## How to contribute to the CSV project

- Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

- Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to have [tests](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/tree/master/packages/csv/test).

- Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/tree/master/packages).

- Documentation is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv-docs) and you are invited to submit a pull request with your changes. For convenience, you can also browse the website and click on the Edit link present at the top of every page.
